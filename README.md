# Quantum-Reinforcement-Learning-with-Parameterized-Quantum-Policy
This project implements Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) using a Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC) as the policy network, trained with REINFORCE and parameter-shift gradients. The agent interacts with a stochastic multi-armed bandit environment and learns to select the optimal action through quantum-classical hybrid learning.
